# Code Organization

- `data analysis.ipynb` Analysis of ground & satellite GHI data to identify the relation b/w them
- `download data.ipynb` To download reanalysis satellite data from CDS(NOAA)

## Data Files

Satellite data has to be called using CDS API, we already have the data. so you could use the sat files for satellite data.
